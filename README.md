# Test.Bash(); 2022 Challenge

As part of Test.Bash() 2022, a series of challenges was put out by Mark
Winteringham and the Ministry of Testing (MoT) Team. Using your tool or tools of choice create
solutions for four different challenges: UI, Visual, API, and Data Management.
I chose [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/).

Robot Framework is a natural language testing framework. One writes their test
cases as one would speak or write the actions they are performing in their
testing. Robot Framework is considered an acceptance testing framework. It is
written in Python and can be expanded into other programming lanaguages. Robot
Framework is open source and supported by the [Robot Framework Foundation](https://robotframework.org/foundation/)
and a large community of practitioners, testers, and developers.

## The Challenges

I have written out solutions for each of the four challenges. Read here about
what each challenge is and then click through to my solution for each.

### UI Challenge - Can we check that a message has been created?

[The UI Challenge](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/challenges/16) asks of us ...

>... how you would mitigate the following risk:
>
>An admin user is unable to see and read the message in the admin portal
>
>If you had to build UI automation to check that messages can be seen and
>read, how would you do it?

[See our solution for the UI Challenge](ui-challenge/README.rst)

### Visual Automation Challenge - Can we check that the correct images are displayed on the home page?

Switching focus from the functionlity of the UI to the visual presentation within the UI the [second challenge](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/challenges/18) asks of us ...

>... how you would mitigate the following risk:
>
>The map isnâ€™t showing the correct location on the homepage
>
>If you had to build automation to visually validate that the image is shown correctly, how would you do it?

[See our solution for the Visual Challenge](visual-challenge/README.rst)

### API Automation Challenge - Can we check that rooms can be created?

[See our solution for the API Challenge](api-challenge/README.rst)

### Data Management Challenge - How do we add and mantain test data in our system?

## Want to learn more about Robot Framework ..?

If you are just being introduced to Robot Framework and would like to learn how
to create Robot Framework tests, Paul Merrill has written [an excellent course](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/robot-framework-refresh/)
over on Test Automation University.
